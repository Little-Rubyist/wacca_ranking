  %h1 About donation and sponsors
  %p
    the server costs are incurred in the operation of OFFCCA.
    We would be very grateful if you could make a donation to help us provide a stable service in the future.
    %br
    We will report the total amount received and the purpose of the donation (month in which it is received only) on a monthly basis.
  %p If you want to send me 100% of the amount, we recommend you to use the one-off service instead of the fixed-amount service. (because of the service fee).

  %h2 For those who are willing to pay a fixed monthly fee for support
  %p We offer a monthly support service called "fantia".
  %p If you can't afford it, but would like to support us, please join the free plan of fantia.

    If you have a Github account, you can also use the Github sponsor.
    %br
    The amount of money and benefits are almost the same.
